## Synopsis

The money program is designed to help families with their finances. At the moment, this program only accepts CSV files with transactin data. The CSV parser right now only works with Capital One 360 CSV files. It may work with other csv files, but this has not been tested.

## Motivation

I struggle to use any mainstream personal finance tool. I have used Mint and plenty of iOS apps. Each tool has it's own problem. My big problem with all of these tools is getting the proper visibility.

## Goals

1. I want to see how much money I have available to me for each day. This amount should take into account future planned expenses for each month.
2. I want to create saving goals that are small buckets that allow me to save for small things like an oil change or large things like a house.
3. I want to share all this information with my wife. No finance tool is designed for families. This must be family friendly.
